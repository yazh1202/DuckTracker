## Problem Statement/Opportunity :
> An e-commerce company wants to build a sample Front End prototype website for their business as the online shopping industry has been growing at an incredible rate, and so have ecommerce challenges. To build a whole website they have chosen Azure Cloud Platform. Build a website that have: Home Page, Product detail Page, Cart, Product Category Page, Checkout Page along with FAQ Bot deployed on Website for customers help.


## Description
> The idea behind the project is to be able to be more productive and improve attention span by practising the Pomodoro technique.
The app starts a Pomodoro timer which keeps track of time where you are productive  and uses repetition of this timer to improve attention span and get more work thereby increasing efficiency.
Repeated cycles improve concentration abilities and the breaks after every cycle form a cue-routine-reward loop with the sound of timer being the cue, the session being the routine and the breaks at the end acting as rewards, this forms a habit.
